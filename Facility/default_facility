# The Composer will aggregate the Actions defined in all the UEs and TestCases that
# are present in the Experiment Descriptor, and order them (low to high).

# These Tasks (which correspond to Tasks defined in 'Executor.Tasks') will be
# run in order by the Executor (Run stage), using the parameters defined in
# Config (if any)
